# Annexation
Mindustry PVP plugin:
* Every team has it's own score
* Every N seconds the game gives points depending on cores amount and size (e.g. shard gives 3 points, foundation gives 4 points and etc)
* In order to win you can either destroy the enemy or get the win score

Works best with [Recapture](https://github.com/Slava0135/Recapture) and [UltraHardCores](https://github.com/Slava0135/UltraHardCores)

You can edit values in ***config.properties***

#### Use JDK 14 (but jar should work on JRE 1.8)
